## 0. Squares simple

Write a function that computes the square value of all integers of a matrix.

    Prototype: def square_matrix_simple(matrix=[]):
    matrix is a 2 dimensional array
    Returns a new matrix:
        Same size as matrix
        Each value should be the square of the value of the input
    Initial matrix should not be modified
    You are not allowed to import any module
    You are allowed to use regular loops, map, etc.
